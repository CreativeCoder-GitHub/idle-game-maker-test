# idle-game-maker-test
This is a test to see what I can do with Idle Game Maker. 
Here is a link to the handbook if you want to use it: https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/help.html
Yes, I am using the Cookie Clicker assets as this is just a test.
BUG ALERT: There is a bug in the game that makes the building icons look weird. This is an Idle Game Maker bug involving spritesheets, and I cannot fix it besides from breaking away from spritesheets, which is really annoying, but I might do it later.
