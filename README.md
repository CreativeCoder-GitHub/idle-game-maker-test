# Idle Game Maker Test
This is a test to see what I can do with Idle Game Maker. 
Here is a link to the handbook if you want to use it: https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/help.html
Yes, I am using the Cookie Clicker assets as this is just a test.
BUG ALERT: There is a bug in the game that makes the building icons look weird. This is an Idle Game Maker bug involving spritesheets, and I cannot fix it besides from breaking away from spritesheets, which is really annoying, but I might do it later.

The original game was made by DashNet. The link to the original Cookie Clicker is here: https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

## Technical Stuff
There isn't a lot to say a lot at this point. I made 2 debug upgrades called "Godly Cursor" and "Elder Ultimate." Yes, the names aren't very creative but they are just debug upgrades. I also had to resize the big cookie to half its size and uploaded it to this repository to fit the sizes in Idle Game Maker. There was probably a better solution but it works.
